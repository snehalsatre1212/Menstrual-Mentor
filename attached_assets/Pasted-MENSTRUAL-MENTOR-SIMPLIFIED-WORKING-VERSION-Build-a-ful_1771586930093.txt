TEXT ANALYSIS LOGIC

Use simple rule-based detection:

If text contains:

late or delay → Delayed Period

tired or fatigue → Low Energy

pain or cramps → Menstrual Pain

irregular → Irregular Cycle

summary,
detectedIssue,

Disclaimer must always say:
"This app provides wellness guidance only and does not replace medical consultation."

CYCLE PREDICTION LOGIC

Calculate cycle length = difference between start dates

Compute average

Predict next period = last start date + average

If cycle <21 → short

averageCycleLength,
nextPeriodDate,
riskLevel,
currentPhase,
